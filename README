Application Description -
Reliable UDP file transfer.

Current limitations -
1. Transfers only text files
2. The file which the client needs to send needs to be in the directory from which you are running the client program

Common Library between client and server -
utilities.h

Server Related Info -
Server files -
server.c - source file for client
makeserver - make file for client

Compiling and running client on a linux/unix based machine with gcc installed -
1. Download all the Server files into a directory
2. To compile run the following command
     make -f makeserver
3. To run server
     ./fserver
Note -
1. Server needs to run before the client.
2. Currently all the files which the server is receiving will be placed in the same directory as where the server program is running.
3. If two clients are transferring a file with the same name, then we can run into issues.


Client Related Info -
Client files -
client.c - source file for client
makeclient - make file for client

Compiling and running client on a linux/unix based machine with gcc installed -
1. Download all the Client files into a directory
2. To compile run the following command
     make -f makeclient
3. To run client
     ./fclient <server ip:port> <filename>
Note - Transfer file needs to be in the same directory as the one you are running this command from. Also works only for text files.
